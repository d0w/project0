                        About
                    </div>
                        <p>The marimba (/məˈrɪmbə/) is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with yarn or rubber mallets to produce musical tones. Resonators or pipes suspended underneath the bars amplify their sound. The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like the keys of a piano, with the groups of two and three accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural bars to aid the performer both visually and physically. This instrument is a type of idiophone, but with a more resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than the xylophone. A person who plays the marimba is called a marimbist or a marimba player.
                            Modern uses of the marimba include solo performances, woodwind and brass ensembles, marimba concertos, jazz ensembles, marching band (front ensembles), drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and orchestral compositions. Contemporary composers have used the unique sound of the marimba more and more in recent years.

                        My Experience
                    </div>
                        <p>The Marimba has been a part of my life for a relatively short amount of time. Only for about 3 years have I played the marimba. Though, as a mallet player, I do play in one the best drumline ensembles in the United States and have been playing with them for almost 4 years.</p>
