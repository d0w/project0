                    <p class="extraInfo">Playing invovles a variety of techniques, knowledge, etc. In order to begin, you first need any mallet instruments such as the marimba and 2-4 mallets.</p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>How to play with 2 mallets</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Start out by holding one mallet in each hand.</li>
                            <li>Hold this with the fingers mostly wrapped around the stick of the mallet.</li>
                            <li>Turn your wrist over slightly so that you can just barely see your pinky knuckles.</li>
                            <li>Strike the keyboard in the middle of the key with a light touch mostly intializing from the wrist.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>How to play with 4 mallets</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The grip is hard to explain, so here's a link to the three types of grips: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1OANPpdA9o">Here</a></li>
                            <li>To make strokes, think about a turning a door knob and that's how the wrist motion should be.</li>
                            <li>To stroke the inner mallets, start from an up position and turn the wrist while trying to keep the other mallet still. Repeat this with repeated motions going up and down slowly.</li>
                            <li>Repeat this process with the outer mallets as well.</li>
                            <li>Another simple stroke is the vertical stroke which is played by just hinging your wrist so that both mallets come upward and then strike the keys with both at the same time.</li>
                            
                        </ol>
